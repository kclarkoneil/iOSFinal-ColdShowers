Rather than writing out specific details about the presentation, simply write “presentation.”  See how many thoughts you can record in three minutes, no matter how small or seemingly unimportant.

Ultimately, it can allow you the freedom to consciously select which thoughts you wish to focus on and which thoughts you would like to let go. The idea of this exercise is to visualize your thoughts (e.g., as pictures, words, or symbols) harmlessly floating away from you.  Try imagining your thoughts as leaves floating past you on a slowly moving river.  If any particular thoughts keep coming up, just allow them to pass by again – notice them, observe them, and let them go.",

Ideally, choose an emotion that you are experiencing right now.  Once you have an emotion in mind, write it down on a piece of paper.  Begin by naming the emotion and then continue with the exercise by drawing a picture that you believe represents this emotion for you. Next, try writing down a related action and sound for the emotion.  Notice what you are experiencing throughout the exercise.

If you think you’re feeling “nothing,” try giving that emotional experience a label … it could even be “bored” or “content.”  Close your eyes and bring your attention towards your current emotional experience – what would this emotion look like if it was an object?  Imagine this object.  Now, open your eyes and redirect your focus towards a physical object in the room.  Mindfully observe this object.  If your attention begins to wander, just gently bring it back to the exercise. Return your focus towards your internal emotional experience.  Next, shift your mindful awareness towards another sensory experience in the room – perhaps noticing a particular sound or smell. ",

Avoid labeling and categorizing what you see outside the window; instead of thinking “bird” or “stop sign”, try to notice the colors, the patterns, or the textures. Pay attention to the movement of the grass or leaves in the breeze, notice the many different shapes present in this small segment of the world you can see.  Try to see the world outside the window from the perspective of someone unfamiliar with these sights. Be observant, but not critical.  Be aware, but not fixated.
